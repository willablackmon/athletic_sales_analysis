## Athletic Sales Analysis

#### The application will take csv files with sales data and do the following:

* Combine and Clean the Data
* Determine which Region Sold the Most Products
* Determine which Region had the Most Sales
* Determine which Retailer had the Most Sales
* Determine which Retailer Sold the Most Women's Athletic Footwear
* Determine the Day with the Most Women's Athletic Footwear Sales
* Determine the Week with the Most Women's Athletic Footwear Sales
* Determine the Week with the Most Women's Athletic Footwear Sales

1. Import the two CSV files, `athletic_sales_2020.csv` and `athletic_sales_2021.csv`, and read them into DataFrames.
2. Check that the columns in the two DataFrames have similar names and data types.
3. Combine the two DataFrames by the rows using an inner join, and reset the index.

Exercise demonstrates the e of DataFrames and Pandas to combine, and perform calculations on data to provide detailed/granular investigations of the data to provide insights into sales patterns.

The application exercises the use of groupby functionality and pivot_table, with the assistance of combines, sorts, filters, and renames.
